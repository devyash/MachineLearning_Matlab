## Adaptive Noise Cancellation using NLMS Algorithm
  This project is written in MATLAB. It uses adaptive filter to improve signal voice. The project input contains 2 voice signals:
  -Reference Signal:(Voise + Noise)
  -Primary Signal: Noise difference resourse.

You can further read about this problem on 
[ Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_filter "Wikepedia Article").
